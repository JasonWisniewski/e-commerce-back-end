## Description
This application creates the back end of a ecommerce website using sequelize.  The application creates a database called ecommerce_db with Category, Product, ProdtuctTag, and Tag tables.  Server routes are created with inquirer to get product data, create new products, update product information and delete products.  This application can do anything necessary for an ecommerece website.

I learned about Sequelize in creating this application.
